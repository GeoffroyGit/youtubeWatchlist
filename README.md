# Project youtubeWatchlist

## What is it all about?

I like to have all the latest videos from the youtube channels I like all in one place.
So this project is about doing just that: ask youtube for a list of all the latest videos and building a web page with all these videos.

## How do I do it?

I simply call youtube API to get the latest videos from each channel.
Then I embed them in a very simple HTML page.
